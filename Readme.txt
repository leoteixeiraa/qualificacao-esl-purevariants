About this project
==================

This project demonstrates how to create own transformations based on JavaScript.
The example JavaScript in <Project>/Script/featureList.js shows how to access elements in pure::variants models. 
The output is a list of features, used in the variant description model, which are stored in a 
simple text file.

Initial configuration
=====================

Open "Variant Project" View and open "Config" properties (context menu). Select item
"Configuration Space" and go to page "Input-Output". Check the shown paths and change them
into valid values if necessary.

No further configuration is required.

Transformation results
======================

The transformation result will be stored in <Project>/output/FeatureList.txt (or what ever path
was specified in the config space properties)
